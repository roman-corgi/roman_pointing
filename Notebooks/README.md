The Notebook roman_pointing_demo.ipynb contains a basic tutorial on how to query a target and calculate its pointing angles using either Dmitry's Roman Space Telescope orbit approximation or querying the JPL Horizons database for a Roman Space Telescope orbit assuming an October 2026 launch. It also shows how to calculate the change in pitch angle between a science target and reference star target as a function of time and generate an appropriate keepout map.

The Notebook RefStarCoverage.ipynb builds upon this tutorial and calculates the change in pitch angle between an input science target and the entire catalog of available reference stars. The user is able to specify which reference stars to consider based off of their rank (column st_psfgrade in RefStar_S10_amendGrade.csv) along with specify the maximum allowable delta_pitch angle. It determines, as a function of time, the solar and pitch angles of the input science target and considered reference stars, the delta_pitch and absolute minimum delta_pitch angles, and the number of reference star options for a given science target. It can save a figure to show these affects along with a csv file that lists the number of days observable for each input science target and potential reference star pair.

The csv file RefStar_S10_amendGrade.csv contains the list of reference stars, their current ranks, and appropriate coordinate, proper motion, parallax, and radial velocity information. The csv is meant to be quickly loaded by the RefStarCoverage notebook so that the user does not have to query information from Simbad or other databases on each reference star.
