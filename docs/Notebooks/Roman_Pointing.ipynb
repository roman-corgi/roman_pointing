The specification of coordinates may be either via the mean equinox of epoch or true equinox of date, so long as all coordinates are self-consistent."

    "## Pointing Angle Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman pointing commands are described as a set of 3 ordered rotations about body-fixed axes in the order: ${\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}, {\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}, {\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}$.  The angles are labeled yaw, pitch, roll, respectively and denoted by $\\psi, \\theta, \\phi$, respectively.  The relationship between the orientation of Roman post re-pointing to its orientation pre re-pointing is therefore:\n",
    "$$ C_1(\\phi) C_2(\\theta) C_3(\\psi) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zero-point Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The zero-point for Roman pointing calculations is defined with ${\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}$ pointing directly at the sun (denoted by $\\odot$), such that ${\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}} \\parallel \\mathbf r_{\\odot/R}$, where $ \\mathbf r_{\\odot/R}$ is the vector from Roman's COM to the sun. In order to establish the relationship between the zero-point spacecraft orientation and our inertial frame, we initially orient Roman such that $\\mathcal B$ is fully aligned with $\\mathcal I$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"roman_pointing0.png\" width=\"600\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "In this, and all subsequent figures, the dashed, colored lines indicate frame $\\mathcal I$ and solid, colored line indicate frame $\\mathcal B$.  The ordering of unit vectors in each case is denoted by red, green, blue (such that the solid blue line is the ${\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}$ direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then compute two sequential rotations to align ${\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}$ with $\\mathbf r_{\\odot/R}$.  The first will be about ${\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}$ by the angle between ${\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}}_3$ and the projection of $\\mathbf r_{\\odot/R}$ onto the ${\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}}_1-{\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}}_3$ plane, which we'll denote as $\\alpha_1$. The second rotation will be about ${\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}$ by the angle between $\\mathbf r_{\\odot/R}$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$, which we'll call $\\alpha_2$.  Therefore, the DCM relating $\\mathcal I$ to the zero-point orientation for a given observatory location is given by:\n",
    "$${{\\vphantom{C}}^{\\mathcal{B}}\\!{C_0}^{\\mathcal{I}}} = C_1(\\alpha_2)C_2(\\alpha_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final zero-point orientation thus leaves $\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$ aligned with the spacecraft-sun direction:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Yaw Zero-point\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the zero-point orientation of ${\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}$ and ${\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}$ is entirely arbitrary and unimportant for the calculation of pitch and roll angles.  Any change to the initial orientation of these directions would be accomplished via rotation about ${\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}$ (yaw).  As yaw is also the first element of the pointing angle set (such that yaw changes are executed first in aligning with a new target), this would represent two sequential yaw changes, which is equivalent to a single yaw maneuver.  That is,  $C_3(\\theta_1)C_3(\\theta_2) \\equiv C_3(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)$.  The values of the pitch and roll angles are entirely decoupled from this, so changing the ${\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}},{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}$ zero-point orientation only impacts the computed yaw maneuver, which is essentially unrestricted for Roman.\n"
